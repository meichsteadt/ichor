      "review": "Where can I start, Jennifer and Sarah Joy from Ichor were great to work with from start to finish. They delivered our website as promised: the back end functionality worked well as we uploaded our menus same day we had a final product, the simple yet elegant design is exactly what we wanted and our customers responded by offering immediate feedback. We had a couple simple glitches that Ichor fixed immediately! I highly recommend anyone seeking to modify an existing website or starting from scratch - these ladies take their jobs seriously and will get it done as promised! They are creative, fun to work with but most of all delivered what was discussed. While we only accomplished stage 1 of 3, I think it's important to note that Ichor did not overpromise their product and is allowing our business to see immediate results at a very fair price, allowing us to grow our website as our business grows. I look forward to our continued business relationship. Thank you Ichor!!! -John Kendall.",
